# A-Study-of-Optimal-Shooting-Angle-in-a-Basketball-Game

In this project, I simulate the trajectories of a basketball as it is launched inside
a court. The ball, initially at rest, is thrown at an initial speed, Umag,0, in the direction de-
scribed by aim angles θ and φ. In flight, the motion of the ball is influenced by gravitational,
drag and Magnus (due to spinning) forces. I examine the trajectories of various shots
which are launched with different initial conditions to explore the optimal shooting angle for
a free throw.
